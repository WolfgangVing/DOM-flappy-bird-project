## About
This project is a mock copy&paste from a course of Web Development.
While learning about DOM Events, the professor thought would be good
to deep the learning in a game aspect.

While initialy I was amiss to the code, during the development I got ideas popping up like crazy, thus I thought of doing my own game like DOM project, after filter some I plan to make a Arrow Flight "game".

For this reason, this project is an part 0 of one (?).
